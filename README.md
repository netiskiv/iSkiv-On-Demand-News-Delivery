A solution to eliminate the need to maintain even a distinct list of email addresses
for sending newsletters. 

This tool is a simple on-demand automated process managed by the user's email application. 

The on-demand process sends an email from the user to the publisher 
to request the last issue (published or to come). 

At the publisher's end, the user email address is registered for sending the last issue 
and deleted after sending.
