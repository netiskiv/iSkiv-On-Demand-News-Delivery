A solution to eliminate the privacy breaches implied by sending newsletter processes.

We can avoid storing passwords using a magic link or so. 
We can't avoid storing email addresses.

Business users frequently choose a "talking" email address revealing their identity and business name.

SECURITY

One way encryption offers secure storage
>> But, it does not permit to recover the email address for sending the newsletter's issue.

SPAM

 To a certain extent, spam is a personal perception depending on what frequency is considered excessive, 
 and how much emails you receive.

MARKETING ECOLOGY
 
Cookies and trackers attract a negative perception. 
Advertising trackers conceptors do not relate to the Newsletter publisher's marketing expectations
They relate to maximizing the Ad network profits.

Do publishers know their marketing expectations?

Trigger interest from their users or clients
Establish a cool communication line with their subscribers

Make them feel secure and private  
Making them feel powerful 
Creating a feeling of scarcity instead of the newsletter usual ras-le-bol

Are as many paths to trigger the users' interest.

ISKIV-ON-DEMAND-NEWS-DELIVERY 

This simple powerful solution offers a language agnostic app to fulfill the publisher goals

and remove the need to maintain a list of email addresses
for sending newsletters.

managed at user demand by the app through the click of a button

Hey, it's a long time I did not receive anything... (scarcity)
I will check ...  (power)
The app triggers an email to the publisher 
to request the last issue published or to come. 

At the publisher's end, the user email address is registered for sending the last issue 
(nothing to store)

The purely statistical anonymous data will provide precious marketing information to the publisher
The app also offers the user to personally interact with the publisher
request content to fit its own areas of interest, etc.
to request a function
or anything else 
and even anonymously, at user choice...

This way marketing data are personalized (think it as a character) but not identified.
