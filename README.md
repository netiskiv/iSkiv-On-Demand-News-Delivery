A solution to eliminate the privacy breaches implied by sending newsletter processes.

We can avoid storing passwords using a magic link or so. 
We can't avoid storing email addresses.

Business users frequently choose a "talking" email address revealing their identity and business name.

SECURITY

One way encryption offers secure storage
>> But, it does not permit to recover the email address for sending the newsletter's issue.

SPAM

 To a certain extent, spam is a personal perception depending on what frequency is considered excessive, 
 and how much emails you receive.

MARKETING ECOLOGY
 
Cookies and trackers attract a negative perception. 
Advertising trackers conceptors do not relate to the Newsletter publisher's marketing expectations
They relate to maximizing the Ad network profits.

Do publishers know their own marketing expectations?

Publishers need to
Trigger interest from their users or clients
Establish a cool communication line with their subscribers

Make them feel secure and private  
Making them feel powerful 
Creating a feeling of scarcity instead of the newsletter usual "ras-le-bol"

Most subscribers do NOT want to receive repetitive information and promotions disconnected from their needs at an improper time.

request content to fit its own areas of interest, etc.
to request a function
or anything else, anonymously or not at user's choice.

At the publisher's end, the user email address is registered for sending the last issue and reply to any request or comment.
